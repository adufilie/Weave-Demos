	  	Document11 : { author : "alsallakh", title : "Radial Sets: Interactive Visual Analysis of Large Overlapping Sets", abstract : "In many applications data tables contain multi-valued attributes that often store the memberships of the table entities to multiple sets such as which languages a person masters which skills an applicant documents or which features a product comes with." },
		Document12 :{ author : "ament", title : "Ambient Volume Scattering", abstract : "We present ambient scattering as a preintegration method for scattering on mesoscopic scales in direct volume rendering. Far-range scattering effects usually provide negligible contributions to a given location due to the exponential attenuation with increasing distance. This motivates our approach to preintegrating multiple scattering within a finite spherical region around any given sample point." },
		Document13 :{ author : "andrews", title : "The Impact of Physical Navigation on Spatial Organization for Sensemaking", abstract : "Spatial organization has been proposed as a compelling approach to externalizing the sensemaking process. However there are two ways in which space can be provided to the user: by creating a physical workspace that the user can interact with directly such as can be provided by a large high-resolution display or through the use of a virtual workspace that the user navigates using virtual navigation techniques such as zoom and pan." },
		Document14 :{ author : "andrienko", title : "Space Transformation for Understanding Group Movement", abstract : "We suggest a methodology for analyzing movement behaviors of individuals moving in a group. Group movement is analyzed at two levels of granularity: the group as a whole and the individuals it comprises. For analyzing the relative positions and movements of the individuals with respect to the rest of the group we apply space transformation in which the trajectories of the individuals are converted from geographical space to an abstract “group space”." },
		Document15 : { author : "athawale", title : "Uncertainty Quantification in Linear Interpolation for Isosurface Extraction", abstract : "We present a study of linear interpolation when applied to uncertain data. Linear interpolation is a key step for isosurface extraction algorithms and the uncertainties in the data lead to non-linear variations in the geometry of the extracted isosurface. We present an approach for deriving the probability density function of a random variable modeling the positional uncertainty in the isosurface extraction." },
		      
	    Document21 : { author : "auzinger", title : "Vessel Visualization using Curved Surface Reformation", abstract : "Visualizations of vascular structures are frequently used in radiological investigations to detect and analyze vascular diseases. Obstructions of the blood flow through a vessel are one of the main interests of physicians and several methods have been proposed to aid the visual assessment of calcifications on vessel walls. Curved Planar Reformation (CPR) is a wide-spread method that is designed for peripheral arteries which exhibit one dominant direction." },
		Document22 : { author : "bakke", title : "Automatic Layout of Structured Hierarchical Reports", abstract : "Domain-specific database applications tend to contain a sizable number of table- form- and report-style views that must each be designed and maintained by a software developer. A significant part of this job is the necessary tweaking of low-level presentation details such as label placements text field dimensions list or table styles and so on. In this paper we present a horizontally constrained layout management algorithm that automates the display of structured hierarchical data using the traditional visual idioms of hand-designed database UIs: tables multi-column forms and outline-style indented lists." },
		Document23 : { author : "barakat", title : "Adaptive Refinement of the Flow Map Using Sparse Samples", abstract : "We present a new efficient and scalable method for the high quality reconstruction of the flow map from sparse samples. The flow map describes the transport of massless particles along the flow. As such it is a fundamental concept in the analysis of transient flow phenomena and all so-called Lagrangian flow visualization techniques require its approximation. The flow map is generally obtained by integrating a dense 1D 2D or 3D set of particles across the domain of definition of the flow." },
		Document24 : { author : "basole", title : "Understanding Interfirm Relationships in Business Ecosystems with Interactive Visualization", abstract : "Business ecosystems are characterized by large complex and global networks of firms often from many different market segments all collaborating partnering and competing to create and deliver new products and services. Given the rapidly increasing scale complexity and rate of change of business ecosystems as well as economic and competitive pressures analysts are faced with the formidable task of quickly understanding the fundamental characteristics of these interfirm networks." },
		      
		Document31 : { author : "bernard", title : "MotionExplorer: Exploratory Search in Human Motion Capture Data Based on Hierarchical Aggregation", abstract : "We present MotionExplorer an exploratory search and analysis system for sequences of human motion in large motion capture data collections. This special type of multivariate time series data is relevant in many research fields including medicine sports and animation. Key tasks in working with motion data include analysis of motion states and transitions and synthesis of motion vectors by interpolation and combination. In the practice of research and application of human motion data challenges exist in providing visual summaries and drill-down functionality for handling large motion data collections. We find that this domain can benefit from appropriate visual retrieval and analysis support to handle these tasks in presence of large motion data." },   
		Document32 : { author : "beyer", title : "ConnectomeExplorer: Query-Guided Visual Analysis of Large Volumetric Neuroscience Data", abstract : "This paper presents ConnectomeExplorer an application for the interactive exploration and query-guided visual analysis of large volumetric electron microscopy (EM) data sets in connectomics research. Our system incorporates a knowledge-based query algebra that supports the interactive specification of dynamically evaluated queries which enable neuroscientists to pose and answer domain-specific questions in an intuitive manner. Queries are built step by step in a visual query builder building more complex queries from combinations of simpler queries." },
		Document33 : { author : "biswas", title : "An Information-Aware Framework for Exploring Multivariate Data Sets", abstract : "Information theory provides a theoretical framework for measuring information content for an observed variable and has attracted much attention from visualization researchers for its ability to quantify saliency and similarity among variables. In this paper we present a new approach towards building an exploration framework based on information theory to guide the users through the multivariate data exploration process. In our framework we compute the total entropy of the multivariate data set and identify the contribution of individual variables to the total entropy." },
		Document34 : { author : "boegl", title : "Visual Analytics for Model Selection in Time Series Analysis", abstract : "Model selection in time series analysis is a challenging task for domain experts in many application areas such as epidemiology economy or environmental sciences. The methodology used for this task demands a close combination of human judgement and automated computation. However statistical software tools do not adequately support this combination through interactive visual interfaces. We propose a Visual Analytics process to guide domain experts in this task. For this purpose we developed the TiMoVA prototype that implements this process based on user stories and iterative expert feedback on user experience." },
		 Document35 : { author : "borkin", title : "What Makes a Visualization Memorable?", abstract : "An ongoing debate in the Visualization community concerns the role that visualization types play in data understanding. In human cognition understanding and memorability are intertwined. As a first step towards being able to ask questions about impact and effectiveness here we ask: “What makes a visualization memorable?” We ran the largest scale visualization study to date using 2070 single-panel visualizations categorized with visualization type (e.g. bar chart line graph etc.) collected from news media sites government reports scientific journals and infographic sources. Each visualization was annotated with additional attributes including ratings for data-ink ratios and visual densities." },
		      
		 Document41 : { author : "borkin2", title : "Evaluation of Filesystem Provenance Visualization Tools", abstract : "Having effective visualizations of filesystem provenance data is valuable for understanding its complex hierarchical structure. The most common visual representation of provenance data is the node-link diagram. While effective for understanding local activity the node-link diagram fails to offer a high-level summary of activity and inter-relationships within the data. We present a new tool InProv which displays filesystem provenance with an interactive radial-based tree layout. The tool also utilizes a new time-based hierarchical node grouping method for filesystem provenance data we developed to match the user’s mental model and make data exploration more intuitive. We compared InProv to a conventional node-link based tool Orbiter in a quantitative evaluation with real users of filesystem provenance data including provenance data experts IT professionals and computational scientists." },
		  Document42 : { author : "bosch", title : "ScatterBlogs2: Real-Time Monitoring of Microblog Messages Through User-Guided Filtering", abstract : "The number of microblog posts published daily has reached a level that hampers the effective retrieval of relevant messages and the amount of information conveyed through services such as Twitter is still increasing. Analysts require new methods for monitoring their topic of interest dealing with the data volume and its dynamic nature. It is of particular importance to provide situational awareness for decision making in time-critical tasks. Current tools for monitoring microblogs typically filter messages based on user-defined keyword queries and metadata restrictions. Used on their own such methods can have drawbacks with respect to filter accuracy and adaptability to changes in trends and topic structure." },
		  Document43 : { author : "brehmer", title : "A Multi-Level Typology of Abstract Visualization Tasks", abstract : "The considerable previous work characterizing visualization usage has focused on low-level tasks or interactions and highlevel tasks leaving a gap between them that is not addressed. This gap leads to a lack of distinction between the ends and means of a task limiting the potential for rigorous analysis. We contribute a multi-level typology of visualization tasks to address this gap distinguishing why and how a visualization task is performed as well as what the task inputs and outputs are. Our typology allows complex tasks to be expressed as sequences of interdependent simpler tasks resulting in concise and flexible descriptions for tasks of varying complexity and scope. It provides abstract rather than domain-specific descriptions of tasks so that useful comparisons can be made between visualization systems targeted at different application domains." },
		 Document44 : { author : "broeksema", title : "broeksema", abstract : "We present a visual analytics solution designed to address prevalent issues in the area of Operational Decision Management (ODM). In ODM which has its roots in Artificial Intelligence (Expert Systems) and Management Science it is increasingly important to align business decisions with business goals. In our work we consider decision models (executable models of the business domain) as ontologies that describe the business domain and production rules that describe the business logic of decisions to be made over this ontology." },
